**Save the (NEW) Dates!**

**Welcome to BlinkOn 15!** We have received a lot of feedback that after 1.6
years of working from home due to the pandemic, folks are feeling screen fatigue
from online meetings and events. Given this, we have adjusted our event down to
two days, Nov 16 & 17th. We are changing things up a bit and will host our event
on hopin, you can register [**here**](https://hopin.com/events/blinkon-15). We
will have the same format, however we will not have our Slack channels as all
networking can be done on the platform. You can also [download the hopin mobile
app](https://hopin.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/360012637371--Mobile-App) on
your device.

## **Logistics**

*   **\[NEW\]** Dates: Nov 16-17, 2021 PST 9a - 12p PST
    *   Programming will start @ 9am PST each day, however you are
                welcome to join up to an hour earlier to find folks in chat, 1:1
                meetings and join our networking on the platform.
*   Location: Virtual

We continue to shift our BlinkOn events to more fairly distribute the burden of
meeting at challenging times. Next time we will prioritize the EMEA region. We
apologize this timing is not convenient for everyone, and to make this event as
accessible as possible, we'll publish all publicly available talks on our
[BlinkOn YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/blinkontalks) and within
the event under "Recordings" as soon as we are able. We hope that you understand
our decision and will join us live, or enjoy recordings on our BlinkOn Channel
when they become available.
